This is my first project in HTML where I have demonstrated the use of forms. This project includes a simple HTML form that allows users to input their name, email, and message.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, all you need is a text editor and a web browser.

Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites required to run or view this project. However, it is recommended to have basic HTML knowledge.

Installing
To install and run this project, simply download the project files and open the "index.html" file in any web browser.

Using the Form
Once the "index.html" file is opened in the web browser, you will see a simple form with three input fields: Name, Email, and Message.

Input Fields
Name: Enter your name in this field.
Email: Enter your email address in this field.
Message: Enter your message in this field.
Submit Button
After filling in the required fields, click on the "Submit" button to submit the form. You will see a message that says "Thank you for submitting the form!"
